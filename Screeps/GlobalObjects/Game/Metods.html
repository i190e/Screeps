    console.log("Used half of CPU already!");
}for(const name in Game.creeps) {

}
Get amount of CPU time used from the beginning of the current game tick. Always returns 0 in the Simulation mode.

Return value
Returns currently used CPU time as a float number.

Game.cpu.halt()
Game.cpu.halt();
This method is only available when Virtual machine is set to Isolated in your account runtime settings.

Reset your runtime environment and wipe all data in heap memory.

Game.cpu.setShardLimits(limits)
Game.cpu.setShardLimits({shard0: 20, shard1: 10});
Allocate CPU limits to different shards. Total amount of CPU should remain equal to Game.cpu.shardLimits. This method can be used only once per 12 hours.

parameter	type	description
limits	object<string, number>	
An object with CPU values for each shard in the same format as Game.cpu.shardLimits.

Return value
One of the following codes:

constant	value	description
OK	0	
The operation has been scheduled successfully.

ERR_BUSY	-4	
12-hours cooldown period is not over yet.

ERR_INVALID_ARGS	-10	
The argument is not a valid shard limits object.

Game.cpu.unlock()
if(Game.cpu.unlockedTime && ((Game.cpu.unlockedTime - Date.now()) < 1000*60*60*24)) {
    Game.cpu.unlock();
}
Unlock full CPU for your account for additional 24 hours. This method will consume 1 CPU unlock bound to your account (See Game.resources). If full CPU is not currently unlocked for your account, it may take some time (up to 5 minutes) before unlock is applied to your account.

Return value
One of the following codes:

constant	value	description
OK	0	
The operation has been scheduled successfully.

ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_RESOURCES	-6	
Your account does not have enough cpuUnlock resource.

ERR_FULL	-8	
Your CPU is unlocked with a subscription.

Game.cpu.generatePixel()
if(Game.cpu.bucket == 10000) {
    Game.cpu.generatePixel();
}
Generate 1 pixel resource unit for 10000 CPU from your bucket.

Return value
One of the following codes:

constant	value	description
OK	0	
The operation has been scheduled successfully.

ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_RESOURCES	-6	
Your bucket does not have enough CPU.

Game.getObjectById(id)
creep.memory.sourceId = creep.pos.findClosestByRange(FIND_SOURCES).id;
const source = Game.getObjectById(creep.memory.sourceId);
Get an object with the specified unique ID. It may be a game object of any type. Only objects from the rooms which are visible to you can be accessed.

parameter	type	description
id	string	
The unique identificator.

Return value
Returns an object instance or null if it cannot be found.

Game.notify(message, [groupInterval])
if(creep.hits < creep.memory.lastHits) {
    Game.notify('Creep '+creep+' has been attacked at '+creep.pos+'!');
}
creep.memory.lastHits = creep.hits;if(Game.spawns['Spawn1'].energy == 0) {
    Game.notify(
        'Spawn1 is out of energy',
        180  // group these notifications for 3 hours
    );
}
Send a custom message at your profile email. This way, you can set up notifications to yourself on any occasion within the game. You can schedule up to 20 notifications during one game tick. Not available in the Simulation Room.

parameter	type	description
message	string	
Custom text which will be sent in the message. Maximum length is 1000 characters.

groupInterval	number	
If set to 0 (default), the notification will be scheduled immediately. Otherwise, it will be grouped with other notifications and mailed out later using the specified time in minutes.
